Question 1: 
The program spawns a thread for santa and the required 
amount of threads for elves and reindeer in main

The elf thread asks questions with delay between
Asking a question means to wait in line for santa to help
santa can only help three at a time
once helped the elves will leave and new elves are allowed help

The deer return to the north pole after a wait
once there they wait for all the reindeer to arrive
once all deer are present they wake santa and wait
santa gathers all the deer then the deer wait for the sleigh
santa readies the sleigh then they all head out
once they are all back the deer leave and repeat the process

santa sleeps and waits to be woken
once woken he will perform one of the tasks explained above
if the choice between the two is available, he will pick deer first
 
Question 2:
My program works by maintaining mutal exclusuion with a monitor
All functions are within this monitor and therefor only
one can be run at a time, preventing any two
critical sections from overlapping

Question 3.1: 
When an elf asks a question they increase a variable then wait
at a condition. The third elf to ask will flip a bool that forces
any future elves to wait at another condition before being counted
Those three elves can only leave once santa signals three times.
Once they are signaled they count down from 3 and once the 
value reaches 0 they signal to allow anyone waiting at the
blocking condition to then be counted

Question 3.2: 
elves are blocked by the frontElves condition which is only signaled
by santa after he is done answering

Question 3.3:
The backElves condition paired with the groupPicked bool locks out extra elves
until the first three are done being released as only then does the
backElves condition get signaled

Question 3.4: 
The if statment that contains santas logic for question answering only runs
if a function in the monitor proves that there is a group waiting for help
the condition that claims a group is waiting for help is only set true
after sleeping is signaled.
Also, santa waits at sleeping until initially signaled by the condition
of a group being made in the first place

Question 3.5:
As reindeer return they increment a counter, once this counter equals 
the total number of reindeer, whichever reindeer that made the numbers
equal will signal a monitor letting santa know to wake up and be ready
to gather reindeer

Question 3.6:
The reindeer if comes before the elf if and both of the values
that determine which is needed are set before the if is reached
In the case that both are needed the deer will come first

Question 3.7: 
reindeer are locked down by a working condition that is only
signaled after santa has finished his run around the world

Question 3.8:
while santa is away elves may still have question but will not be able to
ask them to santa as he will be locked in the critical section inside the first
if statement, only once he is done will he be able to meet the condition
of being ready to answer elf questions
